## Summary

This respository contains the files to meet the requirements of the "interactive visualizations" module 14 homework challenge.

This assignment required building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (see Resources), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels; for the purpose of this exercise, these are known as operational taxonomic units ("OTUs").

The dashboard consists of a drop menu for selecting a dataset sample with corresponding dynamic:

-*demographic table of sample information
* bar chart of the ten largest within the sample
* bubble chart of all OTUs in the sample, scaled by size of presence
